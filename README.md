## An Overview:
- Analysis of the _Perceptron Algorithm_, [Rosenblatt (1958)](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/1959-09865-001.pdf?auth_token=f91cd7ff37dd3ba81e90c6359e48e4dc544163be&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fpsycnet.apa.org%2FdoiLanding%3Fdoi%3D10.1037%252Fh0042519), including the update rule and mistake bound.
- A new _Greedy Perceptron_ with derived mistake bound and experimental comparison to the regular Perceptron.
- Dealing with linearly inseparable data: the _Fuzzy Perceptron_, [Keller and Hunt (1985)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767725&tag=1).
- A re-formulation of the _Fuzzy Perceptron_ using motivation from the Soft-Margin SVM.
